Overview

Microbial metabolic functions are increasingly conceptualized as fitness-regulating traits. However, volatile compounds—the microbial volatilome—remain largely overlooked in trait-based frameworks, despite their central roles in metabolism and ecology.

This repository contains scripts that reproduce the modeling work presented in [DOI: 10.1016/j.tim.2025.08.001], demonstrating how volatile metabolism mediates energy–carbon trade-offs and how volatility itself can drive distinct microbial resource-acquisition strategies in soil ecosystems.
